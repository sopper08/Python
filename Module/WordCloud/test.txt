I am lucky enough to have known David, my best friend, for six years.  He is seventeen years of age.  He is very tall and handsome.  He has a pair of big bright eyes.  He is generous and ready to help others.  Furthermore, he does well at school; he is far ahead of his classmates in subjects, especially in English.
     When I first entered junior high school, I was lazy and naughty.  And I hated to read.  However, David, my classmate then, persuaded me to work harder.  He taught me patiently after school and made me enjoy reading.  We have become good friends in the end.  With his good nature and enthusiasm, he is after my own heart.  Now we still keep in touch, and once in a while we go to the movies, go fishing, or play basketball on weekends
